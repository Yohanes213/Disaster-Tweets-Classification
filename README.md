# Diaster Tweets Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying disaster-related tweets using a pre-trained transformer-based model. The goal is to predict whether a given tweet is related to a disaster or not. The project includes data preprocessing, data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/:** Contains the dataset used for training (`train.csv`).
- **src/:** Includes custom Python modules for text preprocessing, utility functions, and prediction.
- **notebooks/:**
  - `train_model.ipynb:` Jupyter notebook for model training.
- **models/:** Placeholder for saving trained models.
- **config.json:** Configuration file specifying model parameters.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
